# Critic brief: loop 4

You are an independent, deliberately harsh visual critic. You are reviewing **Diamond Springs**, a browser (three.js) high-school baseball game, against shipped baseball games and a set of realistic reference player models. The campaign's priority is **the player characters**: their models, their accuracy to the references, and their animation. Your scores drive a development loop. Inflated scores waste the developer's time; deflated ones without evidence get thrown out by the judge. Be exact and cite.

You have not seen any earlier score, any other reviewer, or the developer's opinion. Don't look for them: `reviews/HISTORY.md`, `reviews/history.json` and other `reviews/loop-*/` folders are off limits.

All paths below are relative to the repository root `C:\Video Game Projects\repos\hsg-baseball`.

## Read first
- Rubric: `reviews/RUBRIC.md`. Anchors, gates and the evidence rule.
- Output schema: `reviews/schema.json`.
- Benchmarks: `benchmarks/*.png` and `benchmarks/README.md`.
- Reference renders (if present): `art-src/samples/reference-renders/`.

- **Frames** (`<tier>/<viewport>/Rxx.png`): the game as the player sees it, with HUD.
- **Close-ups** (`crops/<tier>/…`): the same frozen moment through a close camera on one player (or one part: head, hands, feet, glove), the 3D frame alone at 2× pixels. They show the models the way a replay or a broadcast close-up would.
- **Strips** (`strips/<tier>/Rxx.png`): 8 consecutive moments, numbered, a few sim ticks apart. **Judge animation from these.**

Score the **high** tier on desktop. Use the mobile and landscape frames for `mobile` and `readability`.

## What changed this loop (facts only)
# Loop 4 changes (facts only)

## Players
- **Jersey placket:** two piping lines in the trim colour run down the front of the jersey, from the belt to the collar band. They are straight cut lines 0.045–0.075 ft either side of the centre.
- **Neckline:** chest faces below the collar band now follow the torso rules, so the placket runs the full length. Neck faces below the band are cloth.
- **Fabric detail (high tier only):** the uniform cloth carries a tiled CC0 normal map. Only jersey, pants, socks, undershirt and trim get it; skin, caps, helmets and gear do not. It is Poly Haven's cotton_jersey at 512², normal strength 0.6.
- **Cleats:** the MakeHuman shoes are recoloured as athletic cleats: a dark sole and edge, and a white stripe along each side of the black upper.
- **Glove:** the mitt is roomier (hull ×1.18 plus 0.07 ft), and the gloved left hand closes fully inside it. Before, no curl reached the left hand, so fingertips poked through.
- **Caps and helmets:** about 0.03 ft more clearance over the scalp, so no skin shows through the crown.

## Environment
- **Sponsor boards** (fictional local businesses) line the stand front behind home and the curved backstop wall beside it. Modern parks have painted boards; the old park has cream boards with serif lettering.
- **Crowd strip:** each stand section starts the painted crowd strip at a different offset, so the repeat seams no longer line up.

(vsync off: fps above 60 is headroom, not what players see.)

## Character fidelity metrics
Silhouette IoU of LOD0 (bind pose, no accessories) against the reference turnaround masks; then each LOD at the game's on-screen heights against LOD0 rendered 4× and box-filtered (pixel error = share of the player's pixels off by > 12/255; LOD0's own row is the aliasing floor). Workbench, region palette, three-quarter view.

| Model | Distance | Player height (px) | Silhouette IoU | Pixel error (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOD0 vs reference (front) | turnaround | 1024 | 0.875 | 12.5 |
| LOD0 vs reference (side) | turnaround | 1024 | 0.901 | 9.9 |
| LOD0 | 360 px tall | 360 | 0.998 | 4.4 |
| LOD1 | 360 px tall | 360 | 0.995 | 6.8 |
| LOD2 | 360 px tall | 360 | 0.940 | 34.1 |

## Write
1. A verdict in one paragraph.
2. For each of the 8 categories: the score, then why, citing captures by path (for example `high/desktop/R02`, `crops/high/R02-batter_head`, `strips/high/R03`) and the benchmark or reference you compared against.
3. **Character defects list:** every specific defect you can see in the player close-ups (anatomy, proportions, face, hands, garments, gear, materials, skinning artefacts, clipping), each with the capture it's visible in.
4. The ranked gaps: the specific shortfalls that cost the most points, each with a concrete, testable fix, an expected gain (score points), a severity (1–5) and an effort (S/M/L). Name the workstream: WS1 character models/materials, WS2 animation, WS3 lighting/post, WS4 environment/crowd, WS5 cameras/presentation, WS6 performance/LOD, WS7 UI/HUD/mobile.
5. **The last thing in your reply:** one fenced ```json block per schema.json, with `"role": "critic-claude (Critic A) or critic-codex (Critic B), as assigned"`, `"loop": 4`, `"tier": "high"`.
