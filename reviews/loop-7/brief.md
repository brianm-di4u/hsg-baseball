# Critic brief: loop 7

You are an independent, deliberately harsh visual critic. You are reviewing **Diamond Springs**, a browser (three.js) high-school baseball game, against shipped baseball games and a set of realistic reference player models. The campaign's priority is **the player characters**: their models, their accuracy to the references, and their animation. Your scores drive a development loop. Inflated scores waste the developer's time; deflated ones without evidence get thrown out by the judge. Be exact and cite.

You have not seen any earlier score, any other reviewer, or the developer's opinion. Don't look for them: `reviews/HISTORY.md`, `reviews/history.json` and other `reviews/loop-*/` folders are off limits.

All paths below are relative to the repository root `C:\Video Game Projects\repos\hsg-baseball`.

- **Frames** (`<tier>/<viewport>/Rxx.png`): the game as the player sees it, with HUD.
- **Close-ups** (`crops/<tier>/…`): the same frozen moment through a close camera on one player (or one part: head, hands, feet, glove), the 3D frame alone at 2× pixels. They show the models the way a replay or a broadcast close-up would.
- **Strips** (`strips/<tier>/Rxx.png`): 8 consecutive moments, numbered, a few sim ticks apart. **Judge animation from these.**

Score the **high** tier on desktop. Use the mobile and landscape frames for `mobile` and `readability`.

## What changed this loop (facts only)
# Loop 7 changes (facts only)

## Players
- **Batting helmets and caps:** the front of the rim rides up to the brow (helmet 0.12 ft, cap 0.04 ft higher at the front than round the sides), so the brim sits above the eyes. The helmet's lower edge is one continuous shell round the sides and back, deepest over each ear (0.42 ft below the band) and 0.12 ft at the back, tucking in toward the jaw. Before, each ear flap was a separate panel that read as a strap. Helmets are less glossy (roughness 0.62, was 0.38), so a brim facing the sky no longer reads white.
- **Masks:** the cage runs from the brow to just below the measured chin (0.49–0.56 ft tall by build; was 0.68 ft, which reached the chest).
- **Neckline:** the neck opening has straight sides 0.27 ft either side of the neck, and the collar band follows them round. Before, the neckline was one plane, which ran out along the tops of the shoulders in spikes.
- **Shoulders:** over the shoulders and sleeves the cloth is relaxed less (5 passes, was 22) and sits closer (0.6× the garment thickness), so the shoulders follow the anatomy instead of a padded slab, and more neck shows. All three builds have a little less muscle (lean 0.55, average 0.68, stocky 0.8).
- **Jersey lettering:** the front word is narrower (0.8 ft, was 0.92), so it stays on the chest when the torso turns. Both decals stand 0.045 ft off the cloth (was 0.03) with a stronger depth offset, so the placket piping no longer cuts through letters.
- **Foot planting** (high and medium; idle, ready, stance, bunt and umpire clips): a foot within 0.3 ft of the ground comes down flat onto it. Two-bone leg IK bends the knee to lower the ankle, the foot returns to its rest orientation (heel, ball and edges down) keeping the clip's heading, and the toes straighten. It blends in and out with the clip weight and works on left-handed (mirrored) rigs too. Before, only the lowest sole was grounded; the batter's other foot hovered about 0.07 ft up with its toe raised.

## Animation
- **Ball possession:** once a fielder has the ball, it is drawn in his glove (from the catch until the throw), and in his throwing hand from the start of the throw until release. Before, the held ball was drawn at the sim's point at his feet.

## Tools
- `perf-review.mjs --repeat=N` measures each scene N times and keeps the medians. GPU timer readings vary run to run: the loop-6 medium-mobile night reading of 1.33 ms re-measured at 0.68–0.75 ms (`reviews/loop-6/perf-gpu-repeat.json`). Loop 7's perf rows are medians of 3.

(vsync off: fps above 60 is headroom, not what players see.)

## Character fidelity metrics
Silhouette IoU of LOD0 (bind pose, no accessories) against the reference turnaround masks; then each LOD at the game's on-screen heights against LOD0 rendered 4× and box-filtered (pixel error = share of the player's pixels off by > 12/255; LOD0's own row is the aliasing floor). Workbench, region palette, three-quarter view.

| Model | Distance | Player height (px) | Silhouette IoU | Pixel error (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOD0 vs reference (front) | turnaround | 1024 | 0.878 | 12.2 |
| LOD0 vs reference (side) | turnaround | 1024 | 0.889 | 11.1 |
| LOD0 | 360 px tall | 360 | 0.998 | 4.2 |
| LOD1 | 360 px tall | 360 | 0.994 | 7.1 |

## Write
1. A verdict in one paragraph.
2. For each of the 8 categories: the score, then why, citing captures by path (for example `high/desktop/R02`, `crops/high/R02-batter_head`, `strips/high/R03`) and the benchmark or reference you compared against.
3. **Character defects list:** every specific defect you can see in the player close-ups (anatomy, proportions, face, hands, garments, gear, materials, skinning artefacts, clipping), each with the capture it's visible in.
4. The ranked gaps: the specific shortfalls that cost the most points, each with a concrete, testable fix, an expected gain (score points), a severity (1–5) and an effort (S/M/L). Name the workstream: WS1 character models/materials, WS2 animation, WS3 lighting/post, WS4 environment/crowd, WS5 cameras/presentation, WS6 performance/LOD, WS7 UI/HUD/mobile.
5. **The last thing in your reply:** one fenced ```json block per schema.json, with `"role": "critic-claude (Critic A) or critic-codex (Critic B), as assigned"`, `"loop": 7`, `"tier": "high"`.
