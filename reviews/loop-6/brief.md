# Critic brief: loop 6

You are an independent, deliberately harsh visual critic. You are reviewing **Diamond Springs**, a browser (three.js) high-school baseball game, against shipped baseball games and a set of realistic reference player models. The campaign's priority is **the player characters**: their models, their accuracy to the references, and their animation. Your scores drive a development loop. Inflated scores waste the developer's time; deflated ones without evidence get thrown out by the judge. Be exact and cite.

You have not seen any earlier score, any other reviewer, or the developer's opinion. Don't look for them: `reviews/HISTORY.md`, `reviews/history.json` and other `reviews/loop-*/` folders are off limits.

All paths below are relative to the repository root `C:\Video Game Projects\repos\hsg-baseball`.

## Read first
- Rubric: `reviews/RUBRIC.md`. Anchors, gates and the evidence rule.
- Output schema: `reviews/schema.json`.
- Benchmarks: `benchmarks/*.png` and `benchmarks/README.md`.

- **Frames** (`<tier>/<viewport>/Rxx.png`): the game as the player sees it, with HUD.
- **Close-ups** (`crops/<tier>/…`): the same frozen moment through a close camera on one player (or one part: head, hands, feet, glove), the 3D frame alone at 2× pixels. They show the models the way a replay or a broadcast close-up would.
- **Strips** (`strips/<tier>/Rxx.png`): 8 consecutive moments, numbered, a few sim ticks apart. **Judge animation from these.**

Score the **high** tier on desktop. Use the mobile and landscape frames for `mobile` and `readability`.

## What changed this loop (facts only)
# Loop 6 changes (facts only)

## Players
- **Jersey lettering and back number** are skinned decal meshes. Each is a grid laid onto the dressed torso by rays, 0.03 ft proud of the cloth, carrying the nearest body vertex's skin weights. It wraps the chest and bends with every pose (was a flat plane on the chest bone).
  - The front word spans 0.92 × 0.26 ft, across the chest only.
  - The back number spans 0.85 × 0.85 ft.
  - On mirrored (left-handed) rigs the decal texture is drawn mirrored.
- **Masks:** the catcher's and umpire's cage spans chin to brow again. It had slid to chest height when the cap band moved up.
- **Skin self-light:** raised (16% of albedo plus a small constant), so faces under brims and helmets keep their features.
- **Batting helmets:** less mirror-like (roughness 0.38, was 0.28).
- **Builds:** pulled part way back toward the reference athlete. Lean is weight 0.36 and height 0.72; stocky is weight 0.9 and height 0.5.
- **Headwear shadows:** caps and helmets no longer cast sun or tower shadows: a custom shadow-depth material discards those regions. A brim's shadow had blacked out the face under it; the headwear itself is still lit and visible.
- **Batting helmet ear flaps** continue the shell down over each ear in three rows, curving in under the cheekbone (were flat cards).
- **Low tier** (software GL, slow devices) keeps the plain cone-and-ball trees. The tiered trees cost software GL about 3 fps (loop-5 perf gate).

## After the captures (not in this loop's images)
- **Phone pack size:** the medium pack had grown to 4.04 MB, over its 4 MB budget (the loop-5 commit went in with that test failing). Jersey decal grids are coarser (28 × 8 front, 28 × 14 back; were 36 × 10 and 36 × 20) and the 1024² skin maps are saved at WebP quality 72 (was 82). Medium pack is now 3.63 MB, high 8.27 MB; the perf test passes.

## Performance (real GPU; phone proxy is 4× CPU throttle)

(vsync off: fps above 60 is headroom, not what players see.)

## Character fidelity metrics
Silhouette IoU of LOD0 (bind pose, no accessories) against the reference turnaround masks; then each LOD at the game's on-screen heights against LOD0 rendered 4× and box-filtered (pixel error = share of the player's pixels off by > 12/255; LOD0's own row is the aliasing floor). Workbench, region palette, three-quarter view.

| Model | Distance | Player height (px) | Silhouette IoU | Pixel error (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOD0 vs reference (front) | turnaround | 1024 | 0.875 | 12.5 |
| LOD0 vs reference (side) | turnaround | 1024 | 0.895 | 10.5 |
| LOD0 | 360 px tall | 360 | 0.998 | 4.3 |
| LOD1 | 360 px tall | 360 | 0.994 | 6.9 |
| LOD2 | 360 px tall | 360 | 0.889 | 46.2 |
| LOD0 | 140 px tall | 140 | 0.995 | 10.4 |

## Write
1. A verdict in one paragraph.
2. For each of the 8 categories: the score, then why, citing captures by path (for example `high/desktop/R02`, `crops/high/R02-batter_head`, `strips/high/R03`) and the benchmark or reference you compared against.
3. **Character defects list:** every specific defect you can see in the player close-ups (anatomy, proportions, face, hands, garments, gear, materials, skinning artefacts, clipping), each with the capture it's visible in.
4. The ranked gaps: the specific shortfalls that cost the most points, each with a concrete, testable fix, an expected gain (score points), a severity (1–5) and an effort (S/M/L). Name the workstream: WS1 character models/materials, WS2 animation, WS3 lighting/post, WS4 environment/crowd, WS5 cameras/presentation, WS6 performance/LOD, WS7 UI/HUD/mobile.
5. **The last thing in your reply:** one fenced ```json block per schema.json, with `"role": "critic-claude (Critic A) or critic-codex (Critic B), as assigned"`, `"loop": 6`, `"tier": "high"`.
