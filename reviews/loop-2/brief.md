# Critic brief: loop 2

You are an independent, deliberately harsh visual critic. You are reviewing **Diamond Springs**, a browser (three.js) high-school baseball game, against shipped baseball games and a set of realistic reference player models. The campaign's priority is **the player characters**: their models, their accuracy to the references, and their animation. Your scores drive a development loop. Inflated scores waste the developer's time; deflated ones without evidence get thrown out by the judge. Be exact and cite.

You have not seen any earlier score, any other reviewer, or the developer's opinion. Don't look for them: `reviews/HISTORY.md`, `reviews/history.json` and other `reviews/loop-*/` folders are off limits.

All paths below are relative to the repository root `C:\Video Game Projects\repos\hsg-baseball`.

- **Frames** (`<tier>/<viewport>/Rxx.png`): the game as the player sees it, with HUD.
- **Close-ups** (`crops/<tier>/…`): the same frozen moment through a close camera on one player (or one part: head, hands, feet, glove), the 3D frame alone at 2× pixels. They show the models the way a replay or a broadcast close-up would.
- **Strips** (`strips/<tier>/Rxx.png`): 8 consecutive moments, numbered, a few sim ticks apart. **Judge animation from these.**

Score the **high** tier on desktop. Use the mobile and landscape frames for `mobile` and `readability`.

## What changed this loop (facts only)
# Loop 2 changes (facts only)

## Animation
- Four clips are now CMU motion capture (free for any use; credit in SAMPLES.md), retargeted to the v3 rig:
  - **pitch:** subject 124, take 01. The delivery runs from the set through the leg lift to release, time-warped so release lands at 0.867 s; the follow-through follows.
  - **bat_swing:** take 124_07, from 0.35 s before contact. Contact lands at 0.267 s; the finish follows.
  - **bat_stance:** a slow loop of the stance just before that swing.
  - **throw:** take 143_20, with release at 0.333 s.
  - **run:** take 09_01, one gait cycle, in place, as a 16-frame loop.
- The other clips are unchanged (the v2 retarget).

## Players
- The back number reads the right way round on v3 jerseys. It was mirrored before.
- The jersey's row of faces along the neckline and the sleeve hems is coloured in the trim colour (collar band and cuff piping).
- Caps: the bill covers the front 120° only and tapers to the sides, instead of a half brim. Cap and helmet domes have more segments and are smooth-shaded, as are the mask, glove and catcher's gear.
- The stocky build is heavier and a little shorter.
- Skin gets a small self-light term (9% of its albedo), so faces under brims and helmets keep some definition.

## Lighting
- The camera-side fill light goes from 22% to 30% of the sun.

## Environment
- The painted crowd strip on the stands is at half its former scale: about three rows of fans per 36 ft tile, so fans are life-size next to the players.

## Presentation
- In close-up frames, the ball is sized for the close camera. Before, its minimum size was computed for the far camera, so it looked huge.

## Performance
- Clips keep only rotation tracks plus the pelvis's travel, and are key-optimized.
- Each body form is built the first time an actor wears it.
- The pack's base64 strings are released after parsing.
- Per-frame passes reuse temporaries.
- These landed after loop 1's captures; loop 1's perf.json already measured them.

(vsync off: fps above 60 is headroom, not what players see.)

## Character fidelity metrics
Silhouette IoU of LOD0 (bind pose, no accessories) against the reference turnaround masks; then each LOD at the game's on-screen heights against LOD0 rendered 4× and box-filtered (pixel error = share of the player's pixels off by > 12/255; LOD0's own row is the aliasing floor). Workbench, region palette, three-quarter view.

| Model | Distance | Player height (px) | Silhouette IoU | Pixel error (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOD0 vs reference (front) | turnaround | 1024 | 0.843 | 15.7 |
| LOD0 vs reference (side) | turnaround | 1024 | 0.851 | 14.9 |
| LOD0 | 360 px tall | 360 | 0.997 | 2.6 |
| LOD1 | 360 px tall | 360 | 0.996 | 4.4 |
| LOD2 | 360 px tall | 360 | 0.976 | 17.4 |
| LOD0 | 140 px tall | 140 | 0.993 | 7.0 |
| LOD1 | 140 px tall | 140 | 0.993 | 8.4 |
| LOD2 | 140 px tall | 140 | 0.975 | 18.7 |
| LOD0 | 60 px tall | 60 | 0.976 | 16.1 |

## Write
1. A verdict in one paragraph.
2. For each of the 8 categories: the score, then why, citing captures by path (for example `high/desktop/R02`, `crops/high/R02-batter_head`, `strips/high/R03`) and the benchmark or reference you compared against.
3. **Character defects list:** every specific defect you can see in the player close-ups (anatomy, proportions, face, hands, garments, gear, materials, skinning artefacts, clipping), each with the capture it's visible in.
4. The ranked gaps: the specific shortfalls that cost the most points, each with a concrete, testable fix, an expected gain (score points), a severity (1–5) and an effort (S/M/L). Name the workstream: WS1 character models/materials, WS2 animation, WS3 lighting/post, WS4 environment/crowd, WS5 cameras/presentation, WS6 performance/LOD, WS7 UI/HUD/mobile.
5. **The last thing in your reply:** one fenced ```json block per schema.json, with `"role": "critic-claude (Critic A) or critic-codex (Critic B), as assigned"`, `"loop": 2`, `"tier": "high"`.
